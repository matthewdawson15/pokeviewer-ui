TEST WITH CYPRESSSSSSSSS

**************************

pokemon themed tech test


everything is typed

make sure to type everything in the test

They integrations, lots of integrations, showing types

dont test the whole thing, prove you can test, test something complex

bonus points for accessibility



react, test library, barbar, biffa project, react-test-library, no coverage rules for tests

do you think it should be tested write a test for it

looking into cypress as alternative of react test library


for the tech test, choose something and have a go at testing to the best of your ability

don't have to test the whole thing, write a test for something
