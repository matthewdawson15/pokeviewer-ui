# PokéViewer UI

React, TypeScript and SCSS app to retrieve and visualise Generation 1 Pokémon info from the PokéAPI (https://pokeapi.co/).

## Instructions

Ensure npm and node are installed (I used v20.13.0).

From this directory:

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run start`
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`

Additionally, `npm run build` will build a bundle at `./built`.
